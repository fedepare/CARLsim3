C\+A\+R\+Lsim is an efficient, easy-\/to-\/use, G\+P\+U-\/accelerated library for simulating large-\/scale spiking neural network (S\+NN) models with a high degree of biological detail. C\+A\+R\+Lsim allows execution of networks of Izhikevich spiking neurons with realistic synaptic dynamics on both generic x86 C\+P\+Us and standard off-\/the-\/shelf G\+P\+Us. The simulator provides a Py\+N\+N-\/like programming interface (C/\+C++), which allows for details and parameters to be specified at the synapse, neuron, and network level.

The present release, C\+A\+R\+Lsim 3, builds on the efficiency and scalability of earlier releases (Nageswaran et al., 2009; Richert et al., 2011). The functionality of the simulator has been greatly expanded by the addition of a number of features that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.

All software is available on the \href{http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/index.html}{\tt {\bfseries C\+A\+RL Website}}.

New features include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item improved platform compatibility (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows)
\item real-\/time and offline data analysis tools (see ch7\+\_\+monitoring and ch9\+\_\+matlab\+\_\+oat)
\item a more complete S\+T\+DP implementation which includes neuromodulatory mechanisms (see ch5\+\_\+synaptic\+\_\+plasticity)
\item an automated parameter tuning interface that utilizes evolutionary algorithms to construct functional S\+N\+Ns (see ch10\+\_\+ecj)
\item a test suite for functional code verification (see ch11\+\_\+regression\+\_\+suite)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The simulator was first introduced in 2009 (now referred to as C\+A\+R\+Lsim 1), where it demonstrated near real-\/time performance for 100,000 spiking neurons on a single N\+V\+I\+D\+IA G\+TX 280 (Nageswaran et al., 2009). C\+A\+R\+Lsim 2 added basic support for synaptic conductances, spike-\/timing dependent plasticity (S\+T\+DP), and short-\/term plasticity (S\+TP) (Richert et al., 2011). The present release, C\+A\+R\+Lsim 3, greatly expands the functionality of the simulator by adding a number of features that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.

C\+A\+R\+Lsim was originally written by Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran and Micah Richert. The code is now being maintained and extended by Michael Beyeler, Kristofor Carlson, and Ting-\/\+Shuo Chou.
